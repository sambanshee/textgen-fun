Some fun with nGrams, inspired by C.Stross attempt at full Nekronomikon:

Generates random text from bunch of texts. If you run your own fanfiction through it - do not get embarassed.
I have warned you.

simple usage:
main.py -d ../txt

call help for mor parameters:
main.py -h

Should understand utf-8 and will probably attempt to correctly output to your terminal. 
Tried with russian and english, all other langs should probably work.
